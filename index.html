                <p>DownHearted Soul | Die Hard - Live Life contains different literary pieces that reflect the author's real life. A girl who wrote her life story in the art of literary pieces. All the struggles and pain, loneliness and tears. Songs became her best friend, rythm, harmony and melody became her comforter, lyrics became her voice.</p>
                <p>Paper and pen are the one who listen to her cry, the one accepts her views, the only things that could patiently hold on to her wherever she goes, whenever she wish to pour down all the things she keep in her heart.</p>

                        <h3 style="">The Race</h3>
 
                            <p style="">Looking behind you, there's no one left<br/>
                            But looking forward, you know it's a worthwhile thing<br/>
                            Running as fast as you can, straight, focused,<br/>
                            trying to reach the end</p>
 
                            <p style="">A lot of things can use you stumble<br/>
                            On the way, you may become tired,<br/>
                            may become exhausted<br/>
                            As time pass by, you dropped a lot of water to the ground<br/>
                            But your eyes are looking straight forward to the highest point,<br/>
                            the finish line</p>
 
                            <p style="">Some of the runners already gave up<br/>
                            Walking back to where they came from<br/>
                            Some are stumbled, some are disturbed<br/>
                            Some are complaining, looking on the way and saying,<br/>
                            “It's still too far”<br/>
                            Without looking on how far they ran the race.</p>
 
                            <p style="">Some became weak and stopped running<br/>
                            Some also tried to go on, trying to reach their destination<br/>
                            Gratefully, you're still strong, full of energy and concentration<br/>
                            Your mind was set to the price if you survived and finish the race,<br/>
                            Your hope did not perish, you have a strong spirit.</p>
 
                            <p style="">Life is like a race, it's never been easy<br/>
                            You need a lot of endurance to survive and go on<br/>
                            There are many challenges that can cause you stumble<br/>
                            But if you fell down, you must learn to stand and go on.</p>

                        <h3>GRASS</h3>
 
                            <p>Notice the grass that covered the ground<br/>
                            Down to the Earth, they preserve beauty<br/>
                            Small as they are, they show humility<br/>
                            Not as tall as the trees, but strong enough to endure a hurricane.</p>
 
                            <p>A strong wind strike them<br/>
                            Big flood cove them<br/>
                            Big creatures step on them<br/>
                            But still, they slowly rise up every after the rain</p>
 
                            <p>They might be covered with thick mud<br/>
                            When flood seasons arrive<br/>
                            But they humble themselves<br/>
                            Bowing down and wait till the sun will rise.</p>
 
                            <p>Why not low yourselves as grasses do?<br/>
                            Why not try to humble and accept the due?<br/>
                            Why not endure the pain and do not loss hope?<br/>
                            Why not bow down to let the typhoon pass?</p>
 
                            <p>If you want to be like a proud and strong tree<br/>
                            And exalt yourself  high above those little grasses<br/>
                            If you proudly face the strong hurricane believing you can beat it<br/>
                            Will you be able to see the new things the next morning?</p>
 
                            <p>Uprooted, like the big tree, you will also be<br/>
                            Down to the Earth  dead will be your end<br/>
                            Follow those little grasses on the ground<br/>
                            Humble yourself and you will survive.</p>

                            <p>With all the things happened from the past<br>
                            I survived<br>
                            I stood up firmly<br>
                            I never tried to hide</p>
 
                            <p>With all those difficulties,<br>
                            Someone lend me a hand<br>
                            I found a relief,<br>
                            It's in God's hand</p>
 
                            <p>I cried in vain, asking the same questions, WHY?<br>
                            I'm depressed, I'm weak and so much tired<br>
                            Feeling all the sorrows, I pity myself with that</p>
 
                            <p>Looking back, I realized<br>
                            Those things are just challenges to continue the journey,<br> 
                            Difficulties in Life that will bring you lessons and courage to move on.</p>
 
                            <p>The last teardrop fell to the ground<br>
                            This time I made a promise, this would be the last<br>
                            This last teardrop is a new beginning<br>
                            To recover, regain my strength, conquer my fear</p>
 
                            <p>This last teardrop tought me a lesson<br>
                            Remembering that I'm not alone<br>
                            God is wih me, He will never leave me<br>
                            With this last teardrop, I am free.</p>

                        <p>Blood colored petals<br>
                        Thorny stems and fragrance<br>
                        Hidden deep in the forest<br>
                        This wild flower of beauty</p>
 
                        <p>First look, it seems so gloomy<br>
                        But staring to it, you'll see its real beauty<br>
                        It's fragrance that filled the air around<br>
                        Gives delight and pleasure to the heart</p>
 
                        <p>Those tiny thorns around her<br>
                        Those small leaf blades on her stems<br>
                        Those bloody petals that are clearly seen<br>
                        A dream of fantasy in her hidden smile<br>
                        was her charm</p>
 
                        <p>Among all those flowers and grasses<br>
                        This little wild rose was so different<br>
                        A simple beauty, purity is its wealth<br>
                        Unrecognized but full of grace.</p>
